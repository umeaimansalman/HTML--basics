## 📘 What is HTML?

HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**.  
It is used to create the **structure of web pages**.

HTML tells the browser:
- where headings should appear
- where paragraphs should be placed
- where images and links should be displayed
- how content is organized on a page

HTML is **not a programming language**.  
It is a **markup language** used to structure content.
