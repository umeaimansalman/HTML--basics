## 🧱 What Are HTML Elements?

An HTML element is the basic building block of a web page.

Most HTML elements consist of:
- Opening tag
- Content
- Closing tag

Example structure:

<tagname> Content goes here </tagname>

## 🔖 Common HTML Tags

### 1️⃣ Headings

HTML provides 6 levels of headings:

- <h1> (Largest heading)
- <h2>
- <h3>
- <h4>
- <h5>
- <h6> (Smallest heading)

Headings are used to organize content properly.

### 2️⃣ Paragraph Tag

The <p> tag is used to define a paragraph.

It is used for writing normal text content on a webpage.

---

### 3️⃣ Line Break

The <br> tag is used to break a line.

Unlike most tags, it does not require a closing tag.

---

### 4️⃣ Horizontal Line

The <hr> tag creates a horizontal line across the page.

It is often used to separate sections.

## 🧠 Important Note

HTML tags are not case-sensitive,  
but writing them in lowercase is considered best practice.
