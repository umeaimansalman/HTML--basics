## 🧠 What is Semantic HTML?

Semantic HTML means using HTML tags that clearly describe their meaning.

Instead of using generic tags, we use meaningful tags that tell the browser and developer what the content represents.

## ❌ Non-Semantic Tags

These tags do not describe their purpose clearly:

- <div>
- <span>

They are mainly used for layout or styling.

## ✅ Semantic Tags

Semantic tags describe the role of the content.

### Common Semantic Elements

- <header> → Top section of a webpage
- <nav> → Navigation menu
- <main> → Main content of the page
- <section> → Group of related content
- <article> → Independent content (blog post, news)
- <aside> → Sidebar content
- <footer> → Bottom section of the page
